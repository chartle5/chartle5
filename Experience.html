                  <p>My main engineering experience was my winter design project during my first year of engineering. In groups we had to create a medium fidelity prototype for our client to put a rollator in her trunk with less strain on her back. During this project I gained a lot of experience collaborating within a group to engineer an affective design to assist our client.<br><br> 
                  I've also had experience working as a lifeguard as well as being a food runner/expo at a restaurant in my hometown. During my time in these roles I learned many valuable lessons related to customer sevice as well as being disciplined to show up to work every day on time, and being able to perform.</p></u2>
